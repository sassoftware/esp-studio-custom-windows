# SAS Event Stream Processing Studio Custom Windows

## Overview
Custom windows in SAS Event Stream Processing Studio enable you to create your own windows that can be reused across SAS Event Stream Processing projects. These custom windows can be written in Python or Lua. 

The end user of these custom windows can simply add them to their project and configure them; no coding is required. The custom window code is added to the project package, making it portable. This means that projects that use custom windows work in different environments, even when the custom window has not been added to SAS Event Stream Processing Studio in that environment. 

This repository gives you access to contributed custom windows that can be added to SAS Event Stream Processing Studio.
